MuleDump Skins by BMJ updated by Affajapoz

I will attempt to keep the original BMJ MuleDump skins up to date with the newest releases of MuleDump.

* Lowlands
* Manor
* Trench
* Vault


I will also be putting my skins here. If you want to add your skin here please pm me.

To use these skins.
1. Find muledump.html and rename it muledump.html.bak
2. Find dump.css in the lib folder and rename it dump.css.bak
3. Take the files you downloaded here and place them where the original's were.
